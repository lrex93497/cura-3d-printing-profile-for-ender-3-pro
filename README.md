# cura 3d printing profile for ender 3 pro

This is the setting for the ender 3 pro, a 3d printer to print well. I conclude this after some try, with Creality white 1.75mm PLA Filament. This profile is also good 
for 0.1mm and 0.3mm layer height, but the best is 0.2mm. I choose these settings in this profile because I think it is at the balance of product strength, printing 
speed, and material usage. I suggest using paper masking tape and pasting that on the factory printing bed, which can provide a good griping on the product when in 
printing, without the need to use too much effort to pull it out of the printer bed (if printing on the original printer bed, the product will stick at there hardly, 
which is very hard to pull it out).

See below picture for a Cryptex Combination Safe (7-ring, all number) I printed using the profile:

</br>All moving parts move smoothly, just a little resistence, I haven't sand the parts at all. Such result is quite good for a FDM 3d printer.

Normally, base on this profile, when I want the best quality, I will print in 0.1mm layer height and 40mm/s speed (product surface becomes very fine but print speed is 
very slow). But if I want the best printing speed, 120mm/s and 0.3mm layer height (the surface will be "rough", need more tuning). If I want some product with high 
strength, I suggest using 6-8 layers of walls (profile is 2), which already provides quite a lot of strength. I find the 120mm/s is the max this printer can do, more 
than that, the chances of having printing failure become quite significant. For the infill types, cubic is used as it can provide even strength in both x, y, z-direction 
of the product.

Please also remind that to print with great air ventilation for health concerns (Especially the dust...). And be notice that the print result may be affected by 
variation of the printer (as it is hand-assembled), different environmental conditions, etc. Fine-tune may be needed to get optimum results.
